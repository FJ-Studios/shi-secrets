// ShiSecretsDrivers — per-vendor SecretRotationDriver conformances.
//
// Wave 4 ships three drivers (v1 set, locked 2026-04-20):
//   - DriverOVH         — OVH application-key rotation (sandbox + production)
//   - DriverBrevo       — Brevo transactional-email key rotation
//   - DriverGitHub      — GitHub fine-grained PAT rotation with rate-limit retry
//
// Wave 5 (2026-05-21) adds:
//   - DriverWoodpecker  — Woodpecker CI scoped token management
//     Replaces Gitea OAuth in the Woodpecker + Mattermost deploy spec
//     per operator decision 2026-05-21. Mints scoped CI tokens (TTL ≤ 3600s);
//     admin token resolved from BWClient vault (never plaintext config).
//
// The `SecretRotationDriver` protocol itself lives in ShiSecretsKit
// (declared early in Wave 3 so the RotationEngine could call into it).
// Wave 4 adds the vendor conformances in this target and exposes a
// `allV1Drivers(transport:)` helper so the DI registration in Wave 4
// T52 (BrokerDaemon) can register them in a single shot.

/// Minimal HTTP transport abstraction the drivers call through. Tests
/// inject a fake; production wires a real URLSession-backed implementation.
/// All v1 + Wave 5 drivers share the same surface so the anomaly-path
/// contract test (T46) can parameterize across them.
