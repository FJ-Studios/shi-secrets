// AuditRow — in-memory representation of a `secret_audit` row.
//
// The row is constructed by the broker *before* plaintext is returned to
// the caller (BR-G-01) and handed to AuditWriter (Wave 2) which persists
// it append-only. Column shape here matches migration 0031 one-to-one
// (BR-J-01): ts, token_jti, caller_uid, caller_transport, secret_name,
// op, allow, reason, llm_touched.
//
// `DenyReason` is the closed set of machine-readable reason codes a deny
// row can carry. New reason codes require a schema bump; the broker MUST
// NOT emit free-form strings into `secret_audit.reason`.
